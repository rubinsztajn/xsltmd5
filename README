Here's what we got:

./xsl/*.xml
Example xml file(s) to be transfromed to xhtml

./xsl/*.xsl
The suite of stylesheets used for the transformation.  The only sheet
you need to worry about is print.xsl

./xsl/print.xsl
The master stylesheet.  The template "rdfa" is where my RDFa magic
happens.  I've commented the section where I imagine the md5 function
to be called.  

./xsl/*.html
Example result of transformation, assuming all the md5 shiz happens as hoped.

FWIW, here's the other end of this:

http://gslis.simmons.edu/archival

The pvn:primaryProvenanceOf property links to the xhtml/rdfa finding
aid, which is what we're generating with the transformations and the
md5'd name generates the URI to link back from the xhtml/rdfa representation of
the collection to the person on the Archival service.
